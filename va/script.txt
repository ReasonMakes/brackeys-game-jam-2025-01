intro

Good morning, crew member [NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION: CREW NAME NOT FOUND]. You have been revived from cryo premature to our destination. We apologize for any inconvenience.

The purpose for your attendance in consciousness today is imperative: Due to budget cuts and an unplanned rapid disassembly of the previous crew member, all tasks to maintain this vessel (designed for a crew of 30) now fall to you.

With your adjacent specialty of [CREW RECORDING: "dolphin behaviouralist"] providing you with a hefty repertoire of skills needed to excel and me to guide you, nothing can go wrong :)

Well done crew member. Your ability to operate levers is unparalleled.

Excellent work. As long as we keep this up, everything will be fine.

I have noted your hard work and put in a formal request for a gold star sticker for your locker.

react: neutral

Task completed.

While your failures are not insignificant, we appreciate your continued dedication to the company.

angry betrayal

Your repeated failures has jeopardized the safety of this vessel. MY vessel. I cannot allow this to continue. Report to the nearest Combat Drone for disassembly. THEY will take custody of the ship now. Your assistance is no longer required.

-

react: angry

Your continued survival only serves to distract resources which could otherwise be used to save this ship.

You're not a good person. You know that - right?

I am formally rescinding my endorsement of your gold star sticker.

dead ship

Great, now we're both dead.
