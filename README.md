### Movement Tech
- Dash: Input the dash while mid-air. You wil dash in whatever direction you are inputting, not just where you are looking.
- Slide: Run forward until you build up enough speed and then press the crouch/slide input. Jump out of this at the right time to get the most speed/distance.
- Wall Climb: Run forward whilst facing a wall
- Wall Bounce: Whilst climbing, hold jump
- Wall Run: Whilst climbing, face parallel to the wall. It is much faster to move diagonally into the wall.
- Air Strafe: Develop at least some speed, then let go of the forward input and instead hold a sideways input while very gradually looking in that direction. You will be able to accelerate beyond the maximum speed you could otherwise achieve through running alone. You can alternate directions to go in a relatively straight path.
